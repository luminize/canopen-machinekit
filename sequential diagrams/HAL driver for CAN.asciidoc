==== HAL driver for CAN specs

This document describes the flow of the change of state for various entities.
The source of the diagrams are available in `.msg` format which can be parsed
with link:http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/[with the program MSCgen] to
generate sequential charts.

To keep things simple we try to keep the vertical bars (which are the entities,
or Functions if you will) to a minimum. And try to
follow the PEP mantra:

=== Discover buses

When Machinekit starts, its unknown if and how many devices are on how many
CAN buses.

- precondition: unknown amount of CAN buses
- endcondition: known amount of CAN buses

== Knowing devices

=== Discovering devices

When a/multiple bus(es) exist then we need to figure out which devices are
on the bus. That needs to be done with a signal (Canopen NMT reset node message,
for normal CAN probably by polling. Unknown at this time). We will focus on
CANopen.

- precondition: known CAN bus
- precondition: unknown device
- endcondition: discovered device

=== Defining devices

after knowing about the availability of devices, we need to define the "software
mirror" of our hardware device by knowing at least some information for making
further decisions on how to proceed:
- type
- manufacturer
- profile
- ?

- precondition: discovered device
- endcondition: defined device
